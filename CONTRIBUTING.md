# Contributing to BACH

BACH is a personal project by Lukas Geiger. Contributions are welcome
but there's no guarantee of response time.

## How to contribute

1. Fork the repository
2. Create a feature branch (`git checkout -b feature/my-feature`)
3. Make your changes
4. Run tests (`bach test` or `python -m pytest`)
5. Commit with clear message
6. Open a Pull Request

## Guidelines

- Keep changes focused (one feature/fix per PR)
- Follow existing code style (Python, PEP8-ish)
- Add/update tests if applicable
- Update docs if behavior changes
- Don't break existing functionality

## What gets merged?

- Bug fixes: Almost always welcome
- New features: Open an Issue first to discuss
- Refactoring: Only if it clearly improves something
- New agents/skills: Very welcome as separate modules

## What won't get merged?

- Breaking changes without discussion
- Large refactors without prior agreement
- Features that add complexity without clear benefit
- Changes to CORE (dist_type=2) without good reason
